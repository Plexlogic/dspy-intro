TERM \nTerm of lease \n1.1 Subject to the provisions of this lease, this lease commences on the Commencement Date and ends on the Expiry Date. \nMonthly tenancy \n1.2 If the Landlord in its discretion allows the Tenant to occupy the Premises after the Expiry Date (other than under a grant of a further lease), the Tenant does so as a monthly tenant on the terms and conditions of this lease with necessary changes applicable to a monthly tenancy except that: \n(a) the Base Rent will be an amount equal to one-twelfth of the Base Rent payable immediately before the Expiry Date increased by the Fixed Percentage Amount. \n(b) the first payment of rent is to be made on the next day after the Expiry Date; \n(c) the monthly tenancy may be terminated at any time by either party giving one month\u2019s notice to the other party and the tenancy will end one month after service of that notice; and \n(d) if the Tenant defaults in performing its obligations, then the Landlord may terminate the tenancy by giving notice to the Tenant and the monthly tenancy will end seven days after service of that notice. \n2.

REVIEW OF BASE RENT \nMarket Review of Base Rent \n3.1 If the Landlord chooses to review the Base Rent at any Market Review Date then clauses 3.2 to 3.16 inclusive apply. The Landlord is not obliged to give a notice under clause 3.2. \n3.2 During each Review Period the Landlord may give a Rent Review Notice to the Tenant in respect of the Market Review Date to which that Review Period relates. \nPage 5\nhttps:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1815620\/000119312520253365\/d947560dex104.htm 9\/53 \n2\/20\/23, 6:57 PM EX-10.4 \n3.3 The amount in the Rent Review Notice is the Base Rent reserved by this lease from that Market Review Date unless a Dispute Notice is given by the Tenant within the Dispute Period. \n3.4 If the Landlord does not give the Tenant a Rent Review Notice in respect of a Market Review Date, then as from that Market Review Date until the next Review Date (or if there is no further Review Date, the Expiry Date) the Tenant must continue to pay Base Rent at the rate payable before that Market Review Date; and \nDispute as to Base Rent \n3.5 If the Tenant wants to dispute a Rent Review Notice, then during the Dispute Period the Tenant must give notice to the Landlord: (a) stating that the Tenant disputes the Base Rent assessed by the Landlord; and \n(b) nominating the figure which is the Tenant\u2019s assessment of the Base Rent to apply from the relevant Market Review Date. 3.6 Within 21 days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, the Landlord and the Tenant must agree on an Umpire who will determine the Base Rent. \n3.7 If the Landlord and the Tenant do not appoint the Umpire under clause 3.6, then either party may ask the president of the Institute to appoint the Umpire. \n3.8 An Umpire appointed under this lease: \n(a) must be a full member of not less than five years\u2019standing of the Institute; \n(b) must hold a licence or be registered to practise as a valuer of the kind of premises demised by this lease; \n(c) must have at least three years\u2019 experience in valuing such premises and be active in that market at the time of his or her appointment; \n(d) must have due regard to any evidence submitted by the parties (and, in the case of the Umpire, by the Valuers) as to their assessments of the Base Rent; \n(e) as a condition of the appointment agree to make his or her determination of the Base Rent within 30 days of his or her appointment; \n(f) must give his or her determination and the reasons for that determination (including setting out what was taken into account, what was disregarded, their respective weightings and any other adjustments) in writing; and \n(g) acts as an expert and not as an arbitrator. \n3.9 The determination of the Umpire is final and binding and is the Base Rent as at that Market Review Date. The Umpire\u2019s determination must be a speaking valuation which complies with clause 3.8 (f). \n3.10 If the Umpire does not make his or her determination of the Base Rent within the required period, then either party may ask the president of the Institute to appoint a substitute Umpire.

Any receipt for the payment of Base Rent at a lesser amount due to the Landlord\u2019s delay in issuing the Rent Review Notice does not prejudice the Landlord\u2019s right to demand payment of any additional rent payable by the Tenant as a result of that review. \nPage 7\nhttps:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1815620\/000119312520253365\/d947560dex104.htm 11\/53 \n2\/20\/23, 6:57 PM EX-10.4 \n3.15 If a Rent Review Notice is given after the Market Review Date to which it relates, then any shortfall in the payment of Base Rent as from the Market Review Date must be paid by the Tenant on the first day of the month next following the date of service of the Rent Review Notice. \n3.16 If a Dispute Notice is given by the Tenant, any variation in the Base Rent arising from a determination under this clause 3 takes effect from the relevant Market Review Date. \n3.17 After the determination of the Base Rent: \n(a) if the Base Rent payable is less than that specified in the Rent Review Notice, then the Landlord must credit to the Tenant any excess rent paid by the Tenant in one of the next two rental statements; or \n(b) if the Base Rent payable is greater than that specified in the Rent Review Notice, then the Tenant must pay any deficiency to the Landlord within seven days after the date of the determination. \nConsumer Price Index Adjustment \n3.18 The Base Rent from and including each CPI Adjustment Date until the next Review Date (or if there is no further Review Date, the Expiry Date) is the greater of: \n(a) the Base Rent payable immediately before that CPI Adjustment Date multiplied by the Current CPI and divided by the Previous CPI; and \n(b) the Base Rent payable immediately before that CPI Adjustment Date. \n3.19 On the first day of the month after the information is available to make the calculation in clause 3.18, the Tenant must pay the difference between what the Tenant has paid on account of Base Rent and the Base Rent as adjusted pursuant to clause 3.18 for the period from and including the relevant CPI Adjustment Date to but excluding the first day of that month. \nFixed Percentage Increase \n3.20 The Base Rent from and including each Fixed Increase Date until the next Review Date (or if there is no further Review Date, the Expiry Date) is increased by the Fixed Percentage Increase. \n4. OUTGOINGS \nOutgoings Contribution \n4.1 The Tenant must pay the Outgoings Contribution for each Outgoings Year calculated as follows: \nOC = LP x I x N \nY \nwhere: \nOC = the Outgoings Contribution \nLP = the Tenant\u2019s Proportion \nPage 8\nhttps:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1815620\/000119312520253365\/d947560dex104.htm 12\/53 \n2\/20\/23, 6:57 PM EX-10.4 \nI = the amount of the Outgoings for the relevant Outgoings Year \nN = is the number of days of the Term falling within the relevant Outgoings Year \nY = 365 (or 366 in the case of a leap year). \n4.2 The Landlord may allocate to specific tenants (including the Tenant) Outgoings costs which in the Landlord\u2019s reasonable opinion have been incurred in respect of those tenants or in respect of a particular part of the Building occupied by those tenants. The Landlord must exclude those costs from the Outgoings for which other tenants are liable. The Tenant must pay any cost allocated to it under this clause. \n4.3 The Outgoings for any particular Outgoings Year will be calculated on an accrual basis, unless the Landlord in its discretion decides to calculate the Outgoings on a cash basis. \n4.4 Not used. \n4.5 Not used.. \n4.6 Not used. \nPayment of contributions \n4.7 The Landlord may notify the Tenant of the Landlord\u2019s reasonable estimate of the Outgoings Contribution for each Outgoings Year, and may adjust the reasonable estimate from time to time. \n4.8 The Tenant must pay, on account of the Tenant\u2019s Proportion of the Outgoings Contribution, the estimate notified under clause 4.7, by equal monthly instalments in advance on the days for payment of Base Rent. \n4.9 As soon as practicable after each Outgoings Year the Landlord must give the Tenant a statement for that Outgoings Year with reasonable details of the Outgoings and the Tenant\u2019s Proportion of the Outgoings Contribution payable by the Tenant. \n4.10 Within 14 days after receipt of the statement, the Tenant must pay or the Landlord must credit, the difference between the amount paid on account of the Tenant\u2019s Proportion in the Outgoings Contribution for that Outgoings Year and the amount actually payable by the Tenant. \n4.11 By notice to the Tenant the Landlord may recover any Tenant\u2019s Proportion of the Outgoings Contribution by payment of a lump sum, even if the Landlord has not notified the Tenant of an estimate under clause 4.7 or gives notice after the End Date. \n4.12 The Tenant\u2019s Proportion of the Outgoings Contribution is payable even if the End Date occurs before the relevant amount for any particular Outgoings Year can be calculated. In that case the Landlord\u2019s reasonable estimate at the End Date is taken to be the actual Outgoings Contribution to the End Date without any further adjustment. \n4.13 The Tenant acknowledges that details of the Tenant\u2019s Proportion of any increase in the Outgoings Contribution and Outgoings provided to it at the Commencement Date may have been based on estimates and that the estimates may require revision when the actual amount of the expense is determined. \nPage 9\nhttps:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1815620\/000119312520253365\/d947560dex104.htm 13\/53 \n2\/20\/23, 6:57 PM EX-10.4 \nTenant to pay charges \n4.14 The Tenant must pay on time all: \n(a) waste costs, water costs and other costs which the Landlord reasonably determines to have been incurred in respect of the Premises as a result of the Tenant\u2019s use and occupation of the Premises; \n(b) costs of services separately connected and supplied to the Premises or connected to the Building and separately metered to the Premises including water, electricity, gas and telephone; \n(c) the connection and usage costs of all services not connected and supplied to the Premises but required by the Tenant; and (d) after hours trading costs including but not limited to cleaning electricity gas insurance and security costs and air conditioning . \n5.

In addition, Proprietary Information shall include (x) the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning the Proposed Transaction or that Interested Party has made or may make an offer to acquire Company\u2019s stock or assets or that any Proprietary Information has been shared between the parties and their respective Representatives in connection therewith, (y) the proposed terms and conditions of the Proposed Transaction (including any financial terms and conditions) and the status thereof, and (z) the existence, context, and scope of this Agreement.\nProprietary Information shall not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of any disclosure or other action or inaction by Receiving Party in breach of this Agreement (including any disclosure or other action or inaction by Representatives of Receiving Party that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if undertaken by Receiving Party itself); (ii) is or becomes known or available to Receiving Party or any of its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source (other than Disclosing Party or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or Representatives) that, to the best of the knowledge of Receiving Party, is not prohibited from disclosing such Proprietary Information to Receiving Party by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation; or (iii) is or was independently developed by Receiving Party or any of its Representatives without violation of any obligation under this Agreement.\n1.2 \u201cRepresentatives\u201d means as to any person, its directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, financing sources, attorneys, accountants and their respective Representatives).\n1.3 \u201cperson\u201d shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, partnership, other entity or individual.\n\n2.\tNON-DISCLOSURE AND LIMITED USE.\n2.1 Non-Disclosure. Without the written consent of Disclosing Party and except as otherwise required by applicable law, Receiving Party shall keep, and shall cause its Representatives to keep, all Proprietary Information confidential and shall not disclose or reveal, and shall cause its Representatives not to disclose or reveal, in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, any Proprietary Information to any person, other than to its Representatives who are actively and directly participating in its evaluation of the Proposed Transaction or who otherwise need to know the Proprietary Information for the purpose of evaluating the Proposed Transaction and who are bound by restrictions regarding the disclosure and use of such Proprietary Information (either contractual, legal or fiduciary) owed to Company, Interested Party or any their respective Representatives that are comparable to and no less restrictive than those set forth in this Agreement. Each party shall inform all of its respective Representatives and shall cause its respective Representatives to inform their Representatives who receive Proprietary Information hereunder of the confidential nature of such information and the Proposed Transaction, as well as the terms of this Agreement. Receiving Party shall not, and shall cause its Representatives to not, use any Proprietary Information for any purpose other than to evaluate the Proposed Transaction or in connection with the consummation of the Proposed Transaction. Each party shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by it or its Representatives.\n2.2 Degree of Care. Receiving Party shall take the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential and proprietary information of similar nature and importance (but in no event less than reasonable care) to protect the confidentiality and avoid the use, disclosure, publication or dissemination of the Proprietary Information of Disclosing Party. Receiving Party shall not, and shall cause its Representatives to not, decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer (except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law, notwithstanding a contractual obligation to the contrary) any Proprietary Information or any portion thereof, or determine or attempt to determine any source code, algorithms, methods or techniques embodied in any Proprietary Information or any portion thereof. Receiving Party shall not use Proprietary Information for any purpose or in any manner that would constitute a violation of any laws or regulations, including without limitation the export control laws of the United States.\n2.3 Designated Representatives. Neither Interested Party nor its Representatives shall initiate or maintain contact with any officer, director, stockholder, employee or agent of Company or its subsidiaries regarding the Proposed Transaction, except with the express consent of Company. All (i) communications regarding the Proposed Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information, (iii) requests for on-site access or management meetings and (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures, will be submitted or directed to the Representatives designated by the Company.\n2.4 Compelled Disclosure of Proprietary Information. If Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law or regulation (including, without limitation, any rule, regulation or policy statement of any national securities exchange, market or automated quotation system on which any of Receiving Party\u2019s securities are listed or quoted) or by legal process to disclose any Proprietary Information, or any other information concerning Disclosing Party, its subsidiaries or affiliates, Receiving Party shall provide Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such request or requirement, in order to enable Disclosing Party (a) to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy, (b) to consult with Receiving Party with respect to Disclosing Party\u2019s taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process or (c) to waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or Disclosing Party waives compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement, Receiving Party or its Representatives, as the case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to disclose only that portion of the Proprietary Information which Receiving Party is advised by legal counsel is legally required to be disclosed and exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Proprietary Information so disclosed.\n\n2.5 Attorney-Client Privilege. To the extent that any Proprietary Information may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that they have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the disclosure of such material is not intended to, and shall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege and any such Proprietary Information shall remain entitled to all protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. Nothing in this Agreement obligates any party to reveal material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege.\n2.6 Definitive Agreement. Until a definitive agreement regarding the Proposed Transaction has been executed by the parties hereto, neither party hereto shall be under any legal obligation or have any liability to the other party of any nature whatsoever with respect to the Proposed Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise (other than with respect to the confidentiality and other matters set forth herein). Each party hereto and its Representatives (i) may conduct the process that may or may not result in the Proposed Transaction in such manner as such party, in its sole discretion, may determine (including, without limitation, negotiating and entering into a definitive agreement with any third party without notice to the other party) and (ii) reserves the right to change (in its sole discretion, at any time and without notice to the other party) the procedures relating to the parties\u2019 consideration of the Proposed Transaction (including, without limitation, terminating all further discussions with the other party). For purposes of this Agreement, the term \u201cdefinitive agreement\u201d does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement in principle.\n2.7 No Representations or Warranties Regarding Proprietary Information. Subject to the terms and conditions of a definitive agreement regarding the Proposed Transaction and without prejudice thereto, each party acknowledges that neither the other party nor its Representatives nor any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons of such Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty as to the completeness of the Proprietary Information or any use thereof. Each party hereby expressly disclaims all such warranties, including any implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement and accuracy, and any warranties arising out of course of performance, course of dealing or usage of trade. Receiving Party shall not be entitled to rely on the completeness of any Proprietary Information, but shall be entitled to rely solely on such representations and warranties regarding the completeness of the Proprietary Information as may be made to it in a definitive agreement relating to the Proposed Transaction, subject to the terms and conditions of any such agreement, should the discussions between the parties progress to such a point.\n \n3.\tNO SOLICITATION.\n3.1 No Solicitation of Employees. Interested Party agrees that neither it nor its affiliates will at any time until the one year anniversary of the Effective Date, directly or indirectly, employ or solicit for employment (i) any key technical or management personnel of the Company that has first been introduced by the Company to the Interested Party in connection with the Proposed Transaction or who was otherwise substantively involved in the discussions of the Proposed Transaction or (ii) any other person who is now employed as an officer of the other party or any of its affiliates; provided, that the foregoing restriction shall not be deemed to prohibit Interested Party or its Representatives from making general public solicitations for employment for any position or from employing any employee of the Company who either responds to such a general solicitation for employment or otherwise contacts Interested Party on his or her own initiative and without solicitation by Interested Party in contravention of the above restriction. Additionally, the above restriction shall not be deemed to prohibit Interested Party from making offers of employment or offering retention packages to any employees of Company or any of its affiliates in connection with the Proposed Transaction, provided that such offers have been disclosed to the Board of Directors of the Company.\n \n4.\tSECURITIES ISSUES.\n4.1 No Public Disclosure Required. Each party expressly confirms and agrees that, as of the date hereof, it is not required to make any public disclosure with respect to (a) the Proposed Transaction (or the terms or conditions or any other facts relating thereto), (b) any item of Proprietary Information (or the fact that Proprietary Information has been made available to such party), or (c) any discussions or negotiations taking place between the parties with respect to the Proposed Transaction, whether pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or similar requirements related to general disclosure. If, after the date of this Agreement, either party determines that any such disclosure is required, no such disclosure shall be made unless and until such party consults with the other party regarding the necessity and form of any such disclosure, and provides the other party a reasonable opportunity to review the proposed disclosure and comment thereon.\n4.2 Restrictions on Sales of Securities. Each party is aware, and will advise its Representatives who are informed of the matters that are the subject of this Agreement, of the restrictions imposed by the United States securities laws on the purchase or sale of securities by any person who has received material, non-public information from the issuer of such securities and on the communication of such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information. However, this will not prevent Receiving Party from purchasing stock through its benefit plans in the ordinary course of business.\n \n5.\tOWNERSHIP.\nAll Proprietary Information (including, without limitation, all copies, extracts and portions thereof) is and shall remain the sole property of Disclosing Party, provided, that all Derived Information shall be the sole property of Receiving Party. Receiving Party does not acquire (by license or otherwise, whether express or implied) any intellectual property rights or other rights under this Agreement or any disclosure hereunder, except the limited right to use such Proprietary Information in accordance with the express provisions of this Agreement. All rights relating to the Proprietary Information that are not expressly granted hereunder to Interested Party are reserved and retained by Disclosing Party.\n \n6.\tTERM.\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, the obligations of this Agreement, including the restrictions on disclosure and use, shall terminate on the second anniversary of the Effective Date; provided that Sections 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 and Articles 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.\n \n7.\tREMEDIES.\nReceiving Party agrees that, due to the unique nature of the Proprietary Information, the unauthorized disclosure or use of the Proprietary Information may cause injury to Disclosing Party, the extent of which will be difficult to ascertain and for which there may be no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Receiving Party agrees that Disclosing Company, in addition to any other available remedies, may have the right to seek an immediate injunction and other equitable relief enjoining any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement as ordered by the court. Receiving Party shall notify Disclosing Party immediately if Receiving Party has reason to believe that any person who has had access to the Proprietary Information (including Receiving Party or any of its Representatives) has violated or intends to violate the terms of this Agreement or otherwise disclose any Proprietary Information in violation of the terms hereof. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.\n \n8.\tRETURN OF MATERIALS.\nIf either party hereto shall determine that it does not wish to proceed with the Proposed Transaction, such party shall promptly advise the other party of that decision. In that case, or if the Proposed Transaction otherwise is not consummated for any reason, Receiving Party shall, upon Disclosing Party\u2019s written request, promptly deliver to Disclosing Party all Proprietary Information, and, at Disclosing Party\u2019s sole election, return or destroy (provided that any such destruction shall be certified by a duly authorized Representative of Receiving Party) all copies, reproductions, summaries, analyses or extracts thereof or based thereon (whether in hard-copy form or on intangible media, such as electronic mail or computer files) in Receiving Party\u2019s or any of its Representatives\u2019 possession; provided, that if a legal proceeding has been instituted to seek disclosure of the Proprietary Information, such material shall not be destroyed until the proceeding is settled or a final judgment with respect thereto has been rendered. However, Receiving Party may retain in the office of its legal counsel, one copy of Proprietary Information for record purposes only. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of any Proprietary Information, or documents or material containing or reflecting any Proprietary Information, the parties will continue to be bound by their obligations of confidentiality and other obligations hereunder for the term of this Agreement (or such other term as may be applicable to the specific obligation), except as otherwise specifically provided herein.\n \n9.\tMISCELLANEOUS.\n9.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the confidentiality of the Proprietary Information in connection with the Proposed Transaction and related matters and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous representations, discussions, proposals, negotiations, conditions, communications and agreements, whether oral or written, between the parties relating to the same and all past courses of dealing or industry custom.\n9.2 Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon Interested Party and Company and their respective successors and permitted assigns.\n9.3 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by duly authorized signatories of both parties. The waiver by either party of a breach of or a default under any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of or default under the same or any other provision of this Agreement, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of either party to exercise or avail itself of any right, power, privilege or remedy that it has or may have hereunder operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other further exercise of any such right, power, privilege or remedy hereunder.\n9.4 Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota without regard to conflicts of laws principles.\n\n9.5 Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. The parties hereto agree that any and all actions or proceedings seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any right arising out of, this Agreement shall be brought in the courts of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, including Federal Courts located therein, should Federal jurisdiction requirements exist. Each of the parties consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or proceeding and waives any objection to venue laid therein. Process in any action or proceeding referred to in the preceding sentence may be served on any party anywhere in the world. The parties hereto specifically waive any right to a jury trial with respect to any matter arising under this Agreement.\n9.6 Expenses. In the event of litigation relating to this Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final, non-appealable order that a party has breached this Agreement, then such party shall be liable and pay to the non-breaching party the reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) such non-breaching party has incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, including any appeal therefrom.\n9.7 Severability. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions hereof shall remain in full force and effect and such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.\n9.8 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be delivered under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified; (ii) when sent by confirmed telex or facsimile if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, if not, then on the next business day; (iii) three (3) days after having been sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid; or (iv) one (1) day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier, specifying next day delivery, with written verification of receipt, to the address or facsimile number set forth beneath the name of each party below (or to such other address or facsimile number as such party may designate by five (5) days advance written notice to the other party hereto).\n9.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.\n[SIGNATURES FOLLOW ON THE NEXT PAGE]\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have duly authorized and caused this Non-Disclosure Agreement to be executed as follows:\n \n\t\t\nCOMPANY\n\nCogent, Inc.\n\t\nBy:\t \t\/s\/ Paul Kim\n\t \t(signature)\n\t\nName:\t \tPaul Kim\n\t \t(print)\n\t\nTitle:\t \tChief Financial Officer\n\nINTERESTED PARTY\n\n3M Company\n\t\nBy:\t \t\/s\/ David G.

        "rationale": "produce the recommendations. We need to compare each clause of the contract with the guidelines provided in the Negotiation Playbook to identify any discrepancies or areas for improvement. \n\n1. **Define Confidential Information**: The contract defines \"Proprietary Information\" comprehensively, including written, oral, and electronic communications. This aligns with the playbook.\n\n2. **Term of Confidentiality**: The original contract specifies a term of two years, which was later amended to four years. This falls within the typical range of 2 to 5 years as recommended.\n\n3. **Permitted Disclosures**: The contract allows disclosure to Representatives who need to know the information for evaluating the Proposed Transaction and are bound by similar confidentiality obligations. This is consistent with the playbook.\n\n4. **Exclusions from Confidentiality**: The contract lists exclusions such as publicly available information, information known by the receiving party, and independently developed information. This aligns with the playbook.\n\n5. **Return or Destruction of Information**: The contract includes provisions for the return or destruction of Proprietary Information upon termination or request by the disclosing party. This matches the playbook's recommendation.\n\n6. **No License Granted**: The contract explicitly states that no intellectual property rights or other rights are granted, except the limited right to use the Proprietary Information as per the agreement. This aligns with the playbook.\n\n7. **Governing Law**: The contract specifies that it will be governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota. This is in line with the playbook's recommendation to agree on jurisdiction and governing law.\n\n8. **Remedies for Breach**: The contract details remedies, including injunctive relief and monetary damages, for breaches. This is consistent with the playbook.\n\n9. **Mutual vs. Unilateral NDA**: The contract is mutual, as both parties share confidential information. This is in line with the playbook's guidance to decide on the type of NDA.\n\n10. **Definition of Representatives**: The contract defines \"Representatives\" broadly, including directors, officers, employees, agents, and advisors. This aligns with the playbook.\n\n11. **Obligations of Receiving Party**: The contract outlines the responsibilities of the receiving party to protect and safeguard the Proprietary Information. This matches the playbook.\n\n12. **Non-Circumvention Clause**: The contract does not include a non-circumvention clause. This is a discrepancy with the playbook.\n\n13. **Amendment and Waiver**: The contract states that any changes must be in writing and signed by both parties. This aligns with the playbook.\n\n14. **Severability**: The contract includes a severability clause, ensuring that if one part is unenforceable, the rest remains in effect.
