The Landlord is the registered proprietor of the Land and the Building. 
The Landlord leases to the Tenant the Premises for the Term on the terms and conditions contained in this lease. 
1. TERM 
Term of lease 
1.1 Subject to the provisions of this lease, this lease commences on the Commencement Date and ends on the Expiry Date. 
Monthly tenancy 
1.2 If the Landlord in its discretion allows the Tenant to occupy the Premises after the Expiry Date (other than under a grant of a further lease), the Tenant does so as a monthly tenant on the terms and conditions of this lease with necessary changes applicable to a monthly tenancy except that: 
(a) the Base Rent will be an amount equal to one-twelfth of the Base Rent payable immediately before the Expiry Date increased by the Fixed Percentage Amount. 
(b) the first payment of rent is to be made on the next day after the Expiry Date; 
(c) the monthly tenancy may be terminated at any time by either party giving one month’s notice to the other party and the tenancy will end one month after service of that notice; and

First instalment 
2.2 The Tenant must pay the first instalment of Base Rent on the Commencement Date.

2/20/23, 6:57 PM EX-10.4 
3.3 The amount in the Rent Review Notice is the Base Rent reserved by this lease from that Market Review Date unless a Dispute Notice is given by the Tenant within the Dispute Period. 
3.4 If the Landlord does not give the Tenant a Rent Review Notice in respect of a Market Review Date, then as from that Market Review Date until the next Review Date (or if there is no further Review Date, the Expiry Date) the Tenant must continue to pay Base Rent at the rate payable before that Market Review Date; and 
Dispute as to Base Rent 
3.5 If the Tenant wants to dispute a Rent Review Notice, then during the Dispute Period the Tenant must give notice to the Landlord: (a) stating that the Tenant disputes the Base Rent assessed by the Landlord; and 
(b) nominating the figure which is the Tenant’s assessment of the Base Rent to apply from the relevant Market Review Date. 3.6 Within 21 days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, the Landlord and the Tenant must agree on an Umpire who will determine the Base Rent.

2/20/23, 6:57 PM EX-10.4 
Base Rent criteria 
3.11 In determining the Base Rent, the parties and any Umpire must determine the current market rent on a face rent basis for the Premises as at the particular Market Review Date having regard to the provisions of this lease and must: 
(a) disregard the value of any goodwill attributable to the Tenant’s Business and the value of the Tenant’s Fixtures or fitout or any other interest in the Premises created by this lease; 
(b) disregard any deleterious condition of the Premises resulting from any work carried out by the Tenant or from any breach of this lease by the Tenant; 
(c) disregard any rent or other money payable under any sublease or licence where the rent or other money payable under the sublease or licence is less than the Base Rent; 
(d) have regard to the Term and, if part of the Term has elapsed at the Review Date, disregard that fact; 
(e) have regard to the rental value of comparable premises but in doing so must make no reduction on account of any Incentive; 
(f) consider the Premises as used for the Permitted Use but must have regard also to any other use to which the Premises may be lawfully put; 
(g) regard the Premises on a floor by floor basis without a discount where the Base Rent is to be determined for more than one floor; (h) assume that all obligations of the Tenant and the Landlord in this lease have been performed and observed; 
(i) make no reduction on account of any Incentive paid, provided or allowed to the Tenant or which would be likely to be paid, provided or allowed to a tenant in relation to a new tenancy in respect of the Premises were they vacant; and 
(j) assume that the Building has been reinstated in accordance with clause 8 if the Building has been damaged or destroyed. 
Costs 
3.12 The costs of the Umpire in determining the Base Rent must be paid by the parties equally. 
Minimum Base Rent 
3.13 If a Rent Review Notice is given under clause 3.2, then despite any other provision of this lease, the Base Rent from and including any Market Review Date until the next Review Date or the Expiry Date as appropriate is the greater of: 
(a) the Base Rent determined under this clause 3; and 
(b) the Base Rent payable for the 12 months immediately before that Market Review Date. 
Adjustments 
3.14 If a Rent Review Notice is given under clause 3.2, the Base Rent specified in that notice is payable from the particular Market Review Date, whether or not a Dispute Notice is given by the Tenant. Any receipt for the payment of Base Rent at a lesser amount due to the Landlord’s delay in issuing the Rent Review Notice does not prejudice the Landlord’s right to demand payment of any additional rent payable by the Tenant as a result of that review.

2/20/23, 6:57 PM EX-10.4

3.16 If a Dispute Notice is given by the Tenant, any variation in the Base Rent arising from a determination under this clause 3 takes effect from the relevant Market Review Date. 
3.17 After the determination of the Base Rent: 
(a) if the Base Rent payable is less than that specified in the Rent Review Notice, then the Landlord must credit to the Tenant any excess rent paid by the Tenant in one of the next two rental statements; or 
(b) if the Base Rent payable is greater than that specified in the Rent Review Notice, then the Tenant must pay any deficiency to the Landlord within seven days after the date of the determination. 
Consumer Price Index Adjustment 
3.18 The Base Rent from and including each CPI Adjustment Date until the next Review Date (or if there is no further Review Date, the Expiry Date) is the greater of: 
(a) the Base Rent payable immediately before that CPI Adjustment Date multiplied by the Current CPI and divided by the Previous CPI; and 
(b) the Base Rent payable immediately before that CPI Adjustment Date. 
3.19 On the first day of the month after the information is available to make the calculation in clause 3.18, the Tenant must pay the difference between what the Tenant has paid on account of Base Rent and the Base Rent as adjusted pursuant to clause 3.18 for the period from and including the relevant CPI Adjustment Date to but excluding the first day of that month. 
Fixed Percentage Increase 
3.20 The Base Rent from and including each Fixed Increase Date until the next Review Date (or if there is no further Review Date, the Expiry Date) is increased by the Fixed Percentage Increase. 
4. OUTGOINGS 
Outgoings Contribution 
4.1 The Tenant must pay the Outgoings Contribution for each Outgoings Year calculated as follows:

4.2 The Landlord may allocate to specific tenants (including the Tenant) Outgoings costs which in the Landlord’s reasonable opinion have been incurred in respect of those tenants or in respect of a particular part of the Building occupied by those tenants. The Landlord must exclude those costs from the Outgoings for which other tenants are liable. The Tenant must pay any cost allocated to it under this clause. 
4.3 The Outgoings for any particular Outgoings Year will be calculated on an accrual basis, unless the Landlord in its discretion decides to calculate the Outgoings on a cash basis.

4.9 As soon as practicable after each Outgoings Year the Landlord must give the Tenant a statement for that Outgoings Year with reasonable details of the Outgoings and the Tenant’s Proportion of the Outgoings Contribution payable by the Tenant. 
4.10 Within 14 days after receipt of the statement, the Tenant must pay or the Landlord must credit, the difference between the amount paid on account of the Tenant’s Proportion in the Outgoings Contribution for that Outgoings Year and the amount actually payable by the Tenant. 
4.11 By notice to the Tenant the Landlord may recover any Tenant’s Proportion of the Outgoings Contribution by payment of a lump sum, even if the Landlord has not notified the Tenant of an estimate under clause 4.7 or gives notice after the End Date. 
4.12 The Tenant’s Proportion of the Outgoings Contribution is payable even if the End Date occurs before the relevant amount for any particular Outgoings Year can be calculated. In that case the Landlord’s reasonable estimate at the End Date is taken to be the actual Outgoings Contribution to the End Date without any further adjustment. 
4.13 The Tenant acknowledges that details of the Tenant’s Proportion of any increase in the Outgoings Contribution and Outgoings provided to it at the Commencement Date may have been based on estimates and that the estimates may require revision when the actual amount of the expense is determined.
