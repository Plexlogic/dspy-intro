2/20/23, 7:53 PM EX-10.3 
purposes only, of securities of a company shall not constitute “ownership” or “participation in ownership” for these purposes so long as the equity interest in any such company represents less than 5% of the outstanding capital stock of such company. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no person shall be deemed engaged in Competitive Activities if less than 5% of its revenues are derived from “Competitive Activities” as defined in the next paragraph. 
For such purposes above, “Competitive Activities” mean any business activity involving or relating to owning or operating wireless communication or broadcast towers located in the Restricted Area; provided, however, that if the Company is advised of a business opportunity by the Executive as provided below, and it declines to pursue such business opportunity, the Executive shall be free to pursue such business opportunity and such activity shall not be a “Competitive Activity.” If after the Date of Termination the Executive becomes aware of a business opportunity which involves a Competitive Activity in the Restricted Area, the Executive shall fully advise (in writing and indicating that such information is pursuant to this provision) the Company as to such opportunity and will not pursue it except as provided herein. If, within 15 business days of the Executive’s advising the Company of such business opportunity, the Board fails to adopt a resolution (and provide a certified copy to the Executive) that it will pursue such business opportunity, the Company will be deemed to have declined to pursue such opportunity. If, after a vote by the Board in favor of pursuing a business opportunity, the Company “fails to pursue” such opportunity, then the Company, including for this purpose the Board, shall be deemed to have declined to pursue such business opportunity as of the date it “fails to pursue” such opportunity. “Fails to pursue” means that the Company has failed to pursue such opportunity in a reasonable commercial manner and “fails to pursue” is irrebutably presumed if (x) within 30 days of such vote, the Company has not signed a confidentiality agreement with the parties representing such business opportunity; (y) within 60 days of such vote, the Company has not begun the due diligence process regarding such business opportunity; or (z) within 120 days of such vote, the Company is not in active discussions, or has otherwise terminated its discussions with the parties representing such business opportunity. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section V(a), activities shall not be deemed to be “Competitive Activities” solely as a result of the Executive’s being employed by or otherwise associated with a business of which a unit is in competition with the Company but as to which unit Executive does not have direct or indirect responsibility or direct involvement. 
For purposes of this Agreement, “Affiliate” of a specified person means a person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the person specified. 
(b) For a period of 12 months from the Date of Termination, the Executive shall not knowingly induce any employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates to terminate his or her employment with the Company or any of the Affiliates to work with or for the Executive or any of Executive’s future employers and provided further that the Executive’s response to unsolicited requests for employment references for employees of the Company shall not be a violation of this restriction.

2/20/23, 7:53 PM EX-10.3 
(c) The Executive understands that the restrictions set forth in (a) and (b) above may limit the Executive’s ability to engage in certain businesses in the Restricted Areas during the 12-month period provided for in (a) and (b) above, but acknowledges that the Executive will receive sufficiently high remuneration and other benefits under this Agreement to justify such restrictions. The Executive acknowledges that money damages would not be sufficient remedy for any breach of the provisions of (a) and (b) above by the Executive, and the Company shall be entitled to enforce such provisions by specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for such breach or any threatened breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed the exclusive remedies for such breach, but shall be in addition to all remedies available at law or in equity to the Company, including without limitation, the recovery of damages from the Executive and the Executive’s agents involved in such breach and remedies available to the Company pursuant to other agreements with the Executive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Executive and/or the Executive’s agents breach the restrictions set forth in clauses (a) and/or (b), the Company shall in no circumstances be entitled to recover damages or other compensation in respect of all such breaches in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the amount paid to Executive pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(ii) or 4.2(a)(ii), as applicable. 
(d) It is expressly understood and agreed that the Company and the Executive consider the restrictions contained in (a) and (b) above to be reasonable and necessary to protect the business of the Company. Nevertheless, if any of the aforesaid restrictions are found by an arbitrator or a court having jurisdiction to be unreasonable, or overly broad as to geographic area or time, or otherwise unenforceable, the parties intend for the restrictions therein set forth to be modified by such arbitrator or court so as to be reasonable and enforceable and, as so modified by such arbitrator or court, to be fully enforced. 
VI. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 
6.1 Non-exclusivity of Rights. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Executive’s continuing or future participation in any benefit, bonus, incentive or other Plan provided by the Company or any of its Affiliates and for which the Executive may qualify (including, without limitation, any insurance benefits relating to death or Disability of the Executive), nor shall anything herein limit or otherwise affect such rights as the Executive may have under any other agreements with the Company or any of its Affiliates; provided that, by executing this Agreement, the Executive acknowledges Executive’s ineligibility for, and waives any other right Executive may have to receive, any other severance or termination benefits provided by the Company or its subsidiaries. Amounts which are vested benefits or which the Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any Plan of the Company or any of its Affiliates (other than any severance plan or program of the Company and its subsidiaries) at or subsequent to the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with such Plan except as explicitly modified by this Agreement. 
6.2 Other Payments and Obligations.

Executive under Section 6.3 (b) above or to vest in the Company title to such inventions as against the Executive; provided, however, that the expense of securing any such patent will be borne by the Company. 
(d) The foregoing provisions of this Section 6.3 shall be binding upon the Executive’s heirs, successors and legal representatives. 
(e) In no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section 6.3 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to the Executive under this Agreement. 
6.4 Release and Agreement. As a condition to the receipt of any compensation and benefits under this Agreement, if the Executive’s employment with the Company is subject to a Qualifying Termination, the Executive must first execute a release and agreement (“Release”), in a reasonable commercial form, which shall release the Company and its subsidiaries and their officers, directors, employees and agents from any and all claims or causes of action arising out of the Executive’s employment with the Company or its subsidiaries on the termination of such employment and thereafter not revoke the Release. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if Executive has not delivered to the Company the executed Release on or before the 170th day after the Date of Termination, Executive shall forfeit all payments and benefits payable under Section 4.1 or 4.2 (other than Accrued Obligations), as applicable; provided however, that Executive shall not forfeit such amounts and benefits if (i) the Company has not delivered to Executive the required Release on or before the 30th day following the Date of Termination or (ii) such requirement is not necessary to avoid 409A Taxes. If a payment or benefit could otherwise be paid or provided in different calendar years as a result of the Release requirements, such payment shall be paid or provided in the later calendar year. The performance of the Company’s obligation herein and the receipt of the payments and benefits provided herein to the Executive shall constitute full settlement of all such claims and causes of action and shall provide consideration for the Release. 
6.5 Indemnification; D&O Coverage 
(a) If the Executive is made a party, is threatened to be made a party, or reasonably anticipates being made a party, to any Proceeding by reason of the fact that Executive is or was a director, officer, member, employee, agent, manager, trustee, consultant or representative (“Agent”) of the Company or any of its Affiliates or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Affiliates, as an Agent of another person or if any Claim is made, is threatened to be made, or is reasonably anticipated to be made, that arises out of or relates to the Executive’s service in any of the foregoing capacities, then the Executive shall promptly notify the Company in writing and be indemnified and held harmless to the fullest extent permitted or authorized by the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the Date of Termination (subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law), against any and all costs, expenses, liabilities and losses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ and other professional fees and charges, judgments, interest, expenses of investigation, penalties, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) incurred or suffered by the Executive in connection therewith or in

connection with seeking to enforce Executive’s rights under this Section 6.5(a), and such indemnification shall continue as to the Executive even if Executive has ceased to be an Agent of the Company or other person and shall inure to the benefit of the Executive’s heirs, executors and administrators. The failure to give prompt notice shall only reduce the indemnification obligation to the extent, if any, that the Company is damaged by such breach. The Executive shall be entitled to prompt advancement of any and all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ and other professional fees and charges) incurred by Executive in connection with any such Proceeding or Claim to the fullest extent permitted or authorized by the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the Date of Termination (subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law), any such advancement to be made promptly after Executive gives written notice, supported by reasonable documentation, requesting such advancement. Such notice shall include, to the extent required by applicable law, an undertaking by the Executive to repay the amounts advanced to the extent that Executive is ultimately determined not to be entitled to indemnification against such costs and expenses. Nothing in this Agreement shall operate to limit or extinguish any right to indemnification, advancement of expenses, or contribution that the Executive would otherwise have (including, without limitation, by agreement or under applicable law). For purposes of this Agreement, “Claim” shall include, without limitation, any claim, demand, request, investigation, dispute, controversy, threat, discovery request, or request for testimony or information and “Proceeding” shall include, without limitation, any actual, threatened, or reasonably anticipated, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative, appellate, formal, informal or other. 
(b) Neither the failure of the Company (including its Board, independent legal counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any Proceeding concerning payment of amounts claimed by the Executive under Section 6.5(a) that indemnification of the Executive is proper because Executive has met the applicable standard 
of conduct, nor a determination by the Company (including its Board, independent legal counsel or stockholders) that the Executive has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the Executive has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 
(c) A directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy (or policies) shall be kept in place until the sixth anniversary of the Date of Termination, providing coverage to the Executive that is no less favorable to Executive in any respect (including with respect to scope, exclusions, amounts, and deductibles) than the coverage then being provided to any other present or former senior executive or director of the Company. 
6.6 Successors. 
(a) This Agreement is personal to the Executive and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by the Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive’s legal representatives.

(b) This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company and its successors and assigns. 
(c) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company to assume expressly and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. 
6.7 Statements Concerning Company or Executive. The Executive shall refrain from willfully and knowingly making any public statement, whether oral or written, about the Company, any of its Affiliates, any Executive Officer or any Board Member, that is disparaging or defamatory to any such person. The Company shall use best commercial efforts to cause each Executive Officer and Board Member to refrain from making any public statement, whether oral or written, that is disparaging or defamatory to the Executive. For purposes of this Section 6.7, an “Executive Officer” is the CEO and any officer directly reporting to the CEO, and a “Board Member” is any individual that is a member of the Board. A violation or threatened violation of any of the above prohibitions may be enjoined by any court with jurisdiction. The rights afforded under this provision are in addition to any and all rights otherwise afforded by applicable law. Nothing shall prevent the Executive or the Company from truthfully and publicly correcting incorrect statements or from making truthful disclosures to the extent required (i) by law, by a government agency having supervisory authority over the business of the Company or any of its Affiliates or by any arbitrator, mediator or administrative or legislative body (including a committee thereof) with apparent jurisdiction or (ii) to enforce this Agreement.

Retained Stock shall include (i) restricted stock issued to Executive that is no longer subject to a forfeiture restriction, (ii) stock held in an individual retirement account, 401(k) plan or other qualified plan pursuant to the Code for the primary benefit of the Executive and/or Executive’s spouse and (iii) stock held by the Executive’s spouse.
